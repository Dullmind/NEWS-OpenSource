## Abstract
There is no doubt that **Open Source Software** is now an integral part of our online community as it has been acknowledged and utilized by major companies and organizations across the globe. Having even a brief knowledge of its history will allow you to gain an in-depth understanding of modern day open source.

For all of those that have little to no knowledge in open source, don't worry! This log will be a platform for you to gain all the information you will need to have the basic understanding of Open Source. Call it an open source 101 if you'd like:) 

## Basics 

### What is Open Source Software **(OSS)**? 
In simple words, OSS is coding for a software that is **free and accessible** to the public. A creative approach to define OSS may be that it is **collaborative involvement in the open**. While computers generate binary codes, source code translates softwares into what is a human comprehensible configuration. 

The advantage of OSS is that developers across the globe can collaborate on a single coding project simultaneously. However, there are some cons that come along the way. While the software itself is free, the optimization and support may not be. In addition, it may not be free in terms of license terms - which are the conditions in which the software can be used and redistributed. 

## Brief History
Back when computer age was first developing, software was free to use for all. 


Most software programs had flexible functions amongst computer professionals up to the late 1960’s, considering the scarce number of companies that produced computers. At the time, software came as a **set** with the hardware. Paying for the maintenance was equivalent for producers granting access to the coding. There was not enough value in itself for manufacturers to intend to profit from the softwares. For these reasons, there was no need for the term OSS to exist.  

The norm shifted when SHARE (IBM) first initiated the change in selling software **independently from the hardware.** Then, other companies followed the trend, some attempting (and succeeding) to gain further benefit by incorporating technical or legal limitations in distributing and/or editing softwares. Not a decade had passed when proprietary programs were accustomed. 

As Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of Linux Foundation said, 

> “Software was a finite commodity that people hoarded and wanted to sell as a product.” 

## Modern Day Update 

Despite the domination of proprietary softwares, OSS regained its popularity through universal acknowledgement. 


The international organization, United Nations (UN) recognized that access to free softwares can help reach the sustainable development goals. The UN had initiated and ran technology innovation labs across the world, developing open softwares that is available to all for free. These are the initiatives we desire and require from leading groups with global power.

Some of the most famous Open Source Projects today take such various forms, you may not even have realized they were OSS. The most recognized ones include the online encyclopedia Wikipedia, the internet browser Mozilla Firefox, and the operating system Linux. However, there are more that has to be outlined! 

- VLC Media Player - software used for video, media, audio files; streaming podcasts  
- Python - programming and scripting language for custom software developers 
- LibreOffice - an free office suite 
- Blender - Animation and 3D Graphics tool 
- GIMP - a photo editing tool with 3D party plugins and customization options 
As you can see, the range in variety further proves the necessity of OSS in our society today.

## Conclusion

My intention from this log was to educate you about OSS, however, I don't want to stop here. For this reason, I will continue to contribute into this same log, adding up-to-date information and current news you have to be aware about. 

I hope to see you again!
